# BioSeqTranslator

## Overview

BioSeqTranslator is a Python-based bioinformatics tool designed to facilitate the conversion of DNA sequences into RNA and protein sequences. This tool streamlines genetic analysis, making it easy for researchers and enthusiasts to explore and understand molecular information encoded in DNA.

## Features

- **File Input:** Read DNA sequences from files for efficient processing.
- **Transcription:** Convert DNA sequences to RNA, capturing the genetic information.
- **Translation:** Further convert RNA sequences into protein sequences using the standard genetic code.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bioseqtools.git
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd bioseqtools

3. Run the script:
   python bioseq_translator.py

4. Follow the prompts to input the file path containing the DNA sequence.
